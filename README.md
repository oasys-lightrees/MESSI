# MESSI

**M**essaging, **E**valuation/**S**creening, **S**ystems & **I**ssues — Lightrees' internal
operations and AI workflow platform.

MESSI replaces manual follow-up. A leader defines once what needs asking; the system asks
on schedule, records the answer, notices who did not answer, and turns what the answer
produced into a tracked object.

```
Follow-up module → Cycle (the ask) → Answer → Commitment (action · when · who)
                                            └→ Outcome (approval · signature · meeting · issue · project)
```

The engine is generic — the product is the machine that builds follow-up questions, not any
one module. The launch modules are **MESSI** (messenger screening), **LESTARI** (leads status
reporting), **PRISTA** (project status) and **SHERINA** (schedule request and action); a
sugar mill asking about daily output is the same machinery with different questions.

An AI layer sits over the top, applied only where it produces measurable operational value —
most importantly on the *questions*, before anyone is ever asked.

This repository currently contains the **system design** for the platform. No application
code has been written yet; the design is the artefact under review.

## Design principles

1. **Deterministic software does deterministic work.** AI summarizes, classifies and
   extracts. It never owns state transitions, permissions or arithmetic.
2. **Structure is captured once.** A fact entered during screening is never re-typed to
   become a project, an issue or a report.
3. **Organization-aware from day one.** Every row carries an owning organization even
   though Phase 1 has exactly one. Multi-tenancy in Phase 3 is then a configuration
   change, not a migration.
4. **Measure the outcome, not the AI usage.** Every KPI on the proposal's scorecard has a
   named table, event or metric behind it before the feature ships.
5. **The system should ask less over time, not more.** Every follow-up mechanism has a
   path to a lower cadence — commitment-driven scheduling, auto-decay, archiving. A system
   that only ever adds questions gets ignored wholesale.
6. **Boring until proven otherwise.** One database, one deployable backend, one queue
   mechanism. Extraction into services happens when a measurement demands it.
